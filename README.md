# Decentralized Subscription Management Platform

A blockchain-based platform for managing digital subscriptions with automated billing, usage tracking, and referral programs.

## Overview

This decentralized application (DApp) revolutionizes subscription-based services by providing transparent, automated subscription management through smart contracts. The platform enables businesses to offer flexible subscription plans while ensuring fair billing and usage tracking.

## Architecture

The platform consists of four main smart contract components:

1. **Subscription Contract:** Manages subscription plans
    - Defines subscription tiers and features
    - Handles plan upgrades and downgrades
    - Manages subscription terms and conditions
    - Controls access to subscription features
    - Implements subscription lifecycle management

2. **Billing Contract:** Handles recurring payments
    - Processes automated billing cycles
    - Manages payment methods and tokens
    - Handles subscription cancellations
    - Processes refunds and credits
    - Maintains billing history and receipts

3. **Usage Tracking Contract:** Monitors resource usage
    - Tracks feature utilization
    - Enforces usage limits
    - Generates usage reports
    - Handles quota management
    - Implements fair use policies

4. **Referral Contract:** Manages affiliate programs
    - Tracks referral relationships
    - Calculates reward distributions
    - Manages affiliate tiers
    - Handles reward payouts
    - Prevents referral fraud
